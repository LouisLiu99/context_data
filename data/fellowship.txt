Fellowship Program Description
Over the 20-week program, Fellows participate in online workshops, link up with experienced mentors, and access the resources of the entrepreneurial ecosystem at Northeastern University.

Experienced instructors, who have been small business owners themselves, coordinate the on-demand workshops. Each workshop is three weeks long and require 2-3 hours of reading and interaction with the instructor and the other Fellows.

There are two core workshops that every Fellow takes:

Building Blocks of Strategy
Commercializing Your New Venture
And two ‘elective’ workshops:

Growing and Sustaining Your Venture
Developing Your Leadership Capability
Leading Remote Teams
Supportive Feedback and Coaching for Professionals
Upon successful completion of each workshop, Fellows earn a digital badge from Northeastern University, which will help showcase their newly-acquired competencies.
